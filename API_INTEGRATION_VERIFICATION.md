# API Integration Verification Guide

## Fixed Issue
**Problem:** Frontend forms for donations, expenses, and rent management were not sending data to backend APIs. Form submissions only called parent callbacks without making actual HTTP requests.

**Solution:** Integrated ApiClient into all three form components to make proper API calls with authentication and error handling.

## Verification Steps

### 1. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```
The server should start on `http://localhost:8081`

### 2. Start Frontend Dev Server  
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
The frontend should start on `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Test Donations Form
1. Navigate to Donations page
2. Fill out the form with:
   - Date: Any valid date
   - Category: "Vargani" (will show family members/amount per person fields)
   - Sub-category: Select any option
   - Donor Name: "John Doe" 
   - Amount per Person: 100
   - Family Members: 4
   - Purpose: "Test donation"
3. Submit form
4. **Expected Result:**
   - Network tab shows POST to `/api/donations` 
   - Success dialog appears
   - Form resets after submission
   - Data is saved to database

### 4. Test Expenses Form  
1. Navigate to Expenses page
2. Fill out the form with:
   - Date: Any valid date
   - Category: "Utsav"
   - Sub-category: Select any option  
   - Payee Name: "Test Vendor"
   - Amount: 500
   - Details: "Test expense"
3. Submit form
4. **Expected Result:**
   - Network tab shows POST to `/api/expenses`
   - Success dialog appears
   - Form resets after submission

### 5. Test Rent Management Form
1. Navigate to Rent Management page  
2. Go to "Rent Income" tab
3. Fill out the form (requires existing agreement data)
4. Submit form
5. **Expected Result:**
   - Network tab shows POST to `/api/rent/payments`
   - Success dialog appears
   - Form resets after submission

### 6. Test Error Handling
1. Try submitting any form with missing required fields
2. **Expected Result:**
   - Frontend validation errors appear
   - No API call made until all required fields are filled

3. Try submitting with invalid data (e.g., invalid phone number)
4. **Expected Result:**
   - API call made but returns 422 validation error
   - Backend validation errors displayed to user

### 7. Test Authentication
1. Without logging in, try to submit any form
2. **Expected Result:**
   - API call returns 401 Unauthorized
   - Error message about login requirement displayed

## Key Changes Made

### Donations Component
- Added `import apiClient from "../src/utils/api"`
- Updated `handleSubmit` to call `apiClient.createDonation()`
- Maps form data to backend schema format
- Handles authentication and validation errors

### Expenses Component  
- Added API client import
- Updated `handleSubmit` to call `apiClient.createExpense()`
- Converts file uploads to base64 strings for backend
- Error handling for validation failures

### Rent Management Component
- Added API client import  
- Updated `handleAddRentIncome` to call `apiClient.createRentPayment()`
- Maps rent form data to rent payment schema
- Field name mapping between frontend/backend

### All Components
- Maintain existing success dialog functionality
- Preserve parent callback pattern for UI updates
- Add comprehensive error handling for API failures
- Display backend validation errors to users
- Show authentication errors when not logged in

## Data Structure Mapping

### Donations Schema
```javascript
{
  date: "YYYY-MM-DD",
  category: "Vargani|Dengi|Shaskiy Nidhi", 
  subCategory: "optional string",
  description: "required string",
  amount: number,
  receiptNumber: "optional string",
  donorName: "required string", 
  donorContact: "optional 10-digit string",
  familyMembers: number, // for Vargani only
  amountPerPerson: number // for Vargani only
}
```

### Expenses Schema
```javascript
{
  date: "YYYY-MM-DD",
  category: "Utsav|Gala Kharch|Mandir Dekhbhal",
  subCategory: "optional string", 
  description: "required string",
  amount: number,
  payeeName: "required string",
  payeeContact: "optional 10-digit string",
  receiptImages: ["base64string1", "base64string2"]
}
```

### Rent Payments Schema  
```javascript
{
  agreementId: "required string",
  date: "YYYY-MM-DD", 
  amount: number,
  paymentMethod: "Cash|Check|Bank Transfer|UPI",
  description: "optional string",
  receiptNumber: "optional string"
}
```
